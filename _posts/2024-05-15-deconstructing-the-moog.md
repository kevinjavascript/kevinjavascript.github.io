The Minimoog Model D is more than just a synthesizer; it's an icon. Its warm, powerful sound has graced thousands of records, from Parliament-Funkadelic to Kraftwerk. But what exactly gives it that character? It's a combination of factors, starting with its three famously unstable voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). The slight drift between them creates a rich, phasing chorus effect that is instantly recognizable.

However, the true heart of the Minimoog sound is its patented 4-pole (24 dB/octave) low-pass ladder filter. This is what gives the instrument its ability to produce deep, resonant basses and searing, expressive leads. The filter's non-linear behavior when overdriven is a key part of its magic, adding a layer of saturation that digital emulations often struggle to replicate perfectly.
