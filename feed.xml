Its warm, powerful sound has graced thousands of records, from Parliament-Funkadelic to Kraftwerk. But what exactly gives it that character? It’s a combination of factors, starting with its three famously unstable voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). The slight drift between them creates a rich, phasing chorus effect that is instantly recognizable.</p> <p>However, the true heart of the Minimoog sound is its patented 4-pole (24 dB/octave) low-pass ladder filter. This is what gives the instrument its ability to produce deep, resonant basses and searing, expressive leads. The filter’s non-linear behavior when overdriven is a key part of its magic, adding a layer of saturation that digital emulations often struggle to replicate perfectly.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Synthesis"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A deep dive into the circuitry and design philosophy that gives the legendary Minimoog its timeless sound.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello , world!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/helloworld/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello , world!"/><published>2019-07-06T03:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-07-06T03:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/helloworld</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/2019/helloworld/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="hello-world">Hello world!</h1> <h2 id="hello-world---heading-2">hello world - heading 2</h2> <p>hello world–text</p> <h2 id="hello-world--heading-2">hello world =– heading 2</h2> <p>hello world–text</p> <blockquote> <p>I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling edges. How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow! —when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless; it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.</p> </blockquote> <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">hello</span><span class="o">{</span>
