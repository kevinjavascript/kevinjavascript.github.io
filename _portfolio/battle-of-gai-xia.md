### Behind the Scenes

Creating this composition required extensive research into both the historical event and traditional Chinese musical elements. I spent months studying:
- Ancient Chinese musical scales and modes
- Traditional instruments and their timbres
- Historical accounts of the battle
- Classical Chinese poetry about Xiang Yu

The technical challenge was translating this epic story into a solo Electone performance while maintaining the grandeur and emotional depth of a full orchestral work.

### Future Plans

I'm currently working on expanding this piece into a full orchestral suite, with plans to:
- Add vocal elements inspired by traditional Chinese opera
- Incorporate authentic Chinese instruments
- Develop it into a multimedia performance with visual elements
