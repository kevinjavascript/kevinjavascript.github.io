### Inspiration & Story

The grasslands of Huitengxile have always held a special place in my heart. When I composed this piece in 2016, I wanted to capture not just the visual beauty of the endless green plains, but also the emotional connection I felt to this land.

The melody begins with a gentle, flowing theme that represents the morning mist rolling over the grasslands. As the piece develops, rhythmic elements emerge that echo the galloping of horses and the joyful celebrations of the local festivals.
