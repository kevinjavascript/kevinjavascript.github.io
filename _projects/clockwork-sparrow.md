### Project Deep Dive
For this project, I collaborated closely with the animator to translate their visual storytelling into music. The score was composed in Logic Pro X, using a combination of Spitfire Audio's BBC Symphony Orchestra for the strings and custom-designed synth patches in Serum for the mechanical elements. The main challenge was syncing musical cues to the precise timing of the animation, which I accomplished using SMPTE timecode markers.
