### Project Deep Dive
"Neon Cityscape" was produced in Ableton Live 11. The main melodic themes were developed using Arturia's Prophet-5 V for pads and a hardware Korg Minilogue XD for the lead arpeggio. The drum track was built from custom-recorded foley samples, processed heavily with granular synthesis to create a unique, glitchy rhythm. This project was an exploration of how to create a sense of scale and atmosphere through sound design.
